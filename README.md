1. I have added semantics such as header, main and footer section in index.html file.
2. These semantic elements are used to define different parts of a web page.
3. I have added element in the first half of the element where the navigation links are there.
4. Search engin ... / Online reputation ... / Social Media ... / benefits . .. all these belongs to the main body of the web page, thats why I put all these inside the elements.
5. I have also added in the last part of the body to show a different footer section.
